### Monthly Statistics 

Create a file that includes the year and the month of which you want to display the statistics. 
Put the content of the monthly-statistics.js file into a dataviewjs codeblock.

The result looks like this: 

| Day | Total Duration | Breakdown                                                                                                                      |
